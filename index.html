        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
        Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
        development can range from developing a simple single static page of
        plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps),
        electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive
        list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web
        engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison,
        client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security
        configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web
        development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building
        websites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content
        management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available
        with basic technical skills. For larger organizations and businesses,
        web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (web developers)
        and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing
        websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or
        contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions
        such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web
        development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather
        than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of web
        developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and
        full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior
        and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal
        with the servers.

                  Developer (AKA Client-Side Developer): This is a developer who
                  specializes in the programming of visual user interfaces,
                  including its aesthetics and layouts. A front-end developer
                  code runs on a web browser, on the computer of the user of the
                  site. It is very high-level work, normally far removed from
                  the hardware. It requires an understanding of human-machine
                  interaction and design principles more than computer science
                  theory. Much of a front-end developer’s life is spent dealing
                  with cross-browser compatibility issues and tweaking details
                  of the visual presentation of a UI Front-end development
                  skills include the design of user interface (UI) and user
                  experience (UX), CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and a growing
                  collection of UI frameworks.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Backend Developer (AKA Server-Side Developer): This is a
                  developer who specializes in the design, implementation,
                  functional core logic, performance and scalability of a piece
                  of software or system running on machines that are remote from
                  the end-user. Back-end systems can grow to be very complex,
                  but their complexity is often not visible to the users. For
                  example, consider Google search engine. The front-end part is
                  a very simple UI with a title, a text box, and two or three
                  buttons. The backend is an enormously complex system, able to
                  crawl the web, index it, and find what you are looking for
                  with a growing array of sophisticated mechanisms. A back-end
                  developer works with programming languages such as Java, C,
                  C++, Ruby, Perl, Python, Scala, Go, etc. Back-end developers
                  often need to integrate with a vast array of services such as
                  databases, data storage systems, caching systems, logging
                  systems, email systems, etc.

                  Full-stack Developer: This is a developer that does both
                  front-end and back-end work. He or she has the skills required
                  to create a fully functional web application.

                <p>
                  Middle-Tier Developer: This is a developer who writes non-UI
                  code that runs in a browser and often talking to non-core code
                  running on a server. In general, middle tier is the “plumbing”
                  of a system. The term middle-tier developer is used to
                  describe someone who is not specialized in the front-end or
                  the back-end but can do a bit of both, without being a full
                  stack developer. Only rarely engineers have this as a title,
                  as it is more of a description of a skill set than a career
                  path.

                  Web Developer: Web developers are software engineers who
                  specialize in creating websites. They are either front-end
                  developers, back-end developers, middle-tier developers or
                  full-stack developers. Web-Development became a very common
                  way to enter the software engineering world in the late ‘90s
                  and early 2000s. It has a low entry-point, requiring as little
                  as basic HTML and CSS knowledge. With only a few months of
                  experience, an entry-level web developer can start producing
                  code that ships to production systems. It is a particularly
                  attractive option for people who have no CS fundamentals and
                  want to join the programming world.
